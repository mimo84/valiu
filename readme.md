I am creating this repo to apply for a job position as Full Stack Software Engineer at Valiu.

## How to run this app:

### Client App:

```
cd client
npm install
npm start

The browser should automatically open at [http://localhost:3000].

### Server side app:

```
cd server
npm install
npm run start:dev
```
